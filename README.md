yfa-nodejs-code
===============

This repository is supplemental code to Jim Schubert's book [Your First App: node.js](https://leanpub.com/yfa-nodejs).

The book is a full-stack application development tutorial using what is commonly known as the 'MEAN' stack, but with a heavier focus on the backend technologies: node.js, express.js, and MongoDB. The book ends with a starter AngularJS project of an HTML5 instant messaging chat application.

While following along in the book, it may be useful to run test queries in a REST client. Postman is available for Google Chrome as a packaged application. Import `yfa-nodejs.postman_dump.json` (located in the root of this project) into Postman to evaluate the application's API.
